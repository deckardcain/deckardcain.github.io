In Italy they have finally had enough with forcing non-free software on buyers of PCs and laptops. You can read the story here: [High Court shoots down Windows tax](https://fsfe.org/news/2014/news-20140912-01.en.html)

This is still a problem in most of Europe and I'm not sure on what effect this will have in Italy. However it's clearly a problem and something we need to tell the politicians. 
Forcing non-free software on buyers of PCs and laptops leave them with all most no choice. Even though it's not dictated that they should use the non-free software it's a matter of companies controlling buyers by making it very difficult to avoid paying for Windows while you buy a PC or laptop. (I think the managers at Windows read a lot of Foucault). 

This is not okay. Stop forcing non-free software on us!
